 * 7. Prime numbers can also be generated by an algorithm known as the Sieve of 
 * Erastosthenes.The algorithm for this procedure is presented here.Write a 
 * program that implements this algorithm. Have the program find all prime 
 * numbers up to n = 150.What can you say about this algorithm as compared to 
 * the ones used in the text for calculating prime numbers?
		Sieve of Erastosthenes Algorithm
		To Display All Prime Numbers Between 1 and n
		Step 1: Define an array of integers P. Set all elements P i to 0, 
				2 <= i <= n.
		Step 2: Set i to 2.
		Step 3: If i > n, the algorithm terminates.
		Step 4: If Pi is 0, then i is prime.
		Step 5: For all positive integer values of j, such that i x j â‰¤ n, 
				set Pixj to 1.
		Step 6: Add 1 to i and go to step 3.
